# Remote Control

The objective of this workshop is for you to wield powerful APIs
with minimal code. Think about this as loading up your tool belt

**Part I**

This section is linear and more guided:

You will learn to build an HTML5 app that, when you wave your phone like a magic
wand, everyone's phone will ring and play your favorite song.
