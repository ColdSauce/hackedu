### Part II

This section is less guided. It showcases snippets of various APIs and how to
use them.

With you partner, look around to see what snippets you think are cool.
Pick and choose some of them to build a mini project!

We can break the tools into two categories:

**Actions**

Actions are, well, just actions:

- send a text message (addressed above)
- call a phone and have a computer voice say something (addressed above)
- call a phone and play music
- play music through the web page

**Triggers**

Triggers run any code you want WHEN something happens. For example, you can
run code:

- When a button is pressed
- When the phone is "waved" like a magic wand
- When you receive a text message
